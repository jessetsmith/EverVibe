# EverVibe
Evervibe is an original concept and design for a social media platform for sharing and building community around good vibes. 

Good vibes can be found in how something looks, feels, or the reactions elicited. The aim of EverVibe is to allow people to share the vibes that resonate with them,
and allow others see and spread the good vibes as well, thereby building community on positive ground.
